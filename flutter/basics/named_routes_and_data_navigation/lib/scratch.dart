    // 1. Unified Route Handling: All routes are now handled in onGenerateRoute, making it easier to manage routes from a single place.
    // 2. Removed Redundant Route Declaration: The initial named route / is now handled within onGenerateRoute.
    // 3. Direct Argument Passing: Arguments are handled directly using the settings.arguments property, maintaining a clean and consistent approach.
